**Why should I use Nylo?** Because its syntax is so good you'll reconsider sex.

**What's Nylo's target?** To change the world by changing how we code.

**Wait, how?** You might want to read "How will Nylo change the world". (Yet to be written)

**How is Nylo syntax that awesome?** Giva a look to the [Quick Deep Documentation](https://github.com/veggero/nylo/wiki/Quick-Deep-Documentation).

**Where can I use Nylo?** I'm... still working on it. As you can see.

**When should the interpreter be relased?** I hope to relase the first version on the 25th of May 2018.
