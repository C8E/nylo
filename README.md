## What's Nylo?

**Nylo** is a new programming language ideated by @veggero.
Its __performance__ and its __syntax__ are so awesome that you'll reconsider s*x.

```
fib:
    with int n
    =0 or =1
      1
    else
      fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
```
## How Nylo will help me?

**Nylo** has got a lot of **libraries** that can do **everything** and it also supports __Python modules!__ Isn't that so awesome?
It's going to change how we code, that's it.

## Release day

**Nylo** is going to be released on the **25th of May 2018**.
Support and watch the development on [its repository](https://github.com/pyTeens/nylo).
You can also take a look of the [Quick Deep Documentation](https://github.com/veggero/nylo/wiki/Quick-Deep-Documentation) and [its docs (for now, in Italian)](docs/Nylo.odt).
